<p>This is most likely the last build of Elytra which will be going out to the Public Beta testers. It mostly contains a few minor fixes and two new additions. Read on to learn more.</p>
<h2>New</h2>
<ul>
<li>Long tapping on the All Read button (Double checkmark) in a Feed’s interface will enable you to mark all unread articles as read, including articles not currently loaded in the interface. This is especially useful when you add a new high frequency feed to your list.</li>
<li>You can now optionally use a Dark Application Icon for Elytra. A new <strong>Miscellaneous</strong> section has been added under settings.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Tweaked the Application Icons to render correctly on displays which use the sRGB colour profile.</li>
<li>Updated the footer text in the Subscriptions Interface to be compliant with Apple’s requirements. This is critically useful for you as well as I have come to realise. (I’m secretly hoping Elytra passes Apple’s review in the first go, as we all do :D)</li>
<li>Fixed application launch on iPads when running Elytra for the first time on the device.</li>
<li>Scrolling to load the next batch of articles now consumes less power. This is done less frequently now by using an alternate system API.</li>
<li>Fixed the status bar being dark (when a dark theme is selected) for the Move Folder interface.</li>
<li>Tapping on the <strong>Close</strong> button on iPads now deselects the currently selected article.</li>
</ul>
