The February 2024 release brings a improvements and bug fixes to both the iOS and mac apps.

If you feel generous and have a couple of minutes, please leave a [review on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1433266971?action=write-review). It makes a huge difference for me. Thank you in advance.

- Fixed taking changes from folder updates (feeds added, removed)

- Fixed feed local metadata not persisting

- Fixed loading favicons

- Fixed local notifications title and body being swapped. Title articles/excerpts will now be readable.

- Fixed a bug where adding/deleting feeds would require an app restart for it to take effect.

- `macOS`: Added Internet Access Policy
