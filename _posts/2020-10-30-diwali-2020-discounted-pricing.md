<p>This year for Diwali 2020, a few of us developers have decided to offer discounted pricing in our apps. Elytra is a part of that list and starting today (30<sup>th</sup> Oct, 2020) Elytra’s Monthly and Yearly pricing is discounted up to the 27th of November. </p>
<p>The Monthly subscription is currently discounted to $0.49 and the yearly subscription to $4.99 during the offer period. </p>
<p>If you’re on the 14-Day trial, now is a perfect time to upgrade to the subscription. </p>
<p>However, this is not the new pricing. The pricing is only valid for your first (or upcoming) renewal cycle. If you are already subscribed and your renewal window falls between these two dates, you will be charged the discounted pricing. </p>
<p>In the following renewal cycle, you will be charged the regular amount. Now this whole thing might sound a little confusing so here’s a quick chart to explain things visually using the Monthly subscription as an example: </p>
