The January 2024 release brings a improvements and bug fixes to both the iOS and mac apps.

If you feel generous and have a couple of minutes, please leave a [review on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1433266971?action=write-review). It makes a huge difference for me. Thank you in advance.

- Notifications from smart folders now open the smart folder instead of the article's feed. Local and push notifications from feeds retain existing behaviour.
- Local notifications are now delivered more reliably.
- Moving feeds across folders or out of folders no longer crashes the app.
- Folder counts are now updated more reliably, using fewer resources.
- `macOS`: Implements importing/exporting feed settings under the "File" menu.
- `macOS`: Fixed subscribing and unsubscribing to push notifications on a feed.
- `iOS`: Fixed adding feed from the share extension would not display the correct UI
