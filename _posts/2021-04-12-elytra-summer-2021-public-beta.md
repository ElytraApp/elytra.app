<p>You’ve been waiting for this, haven’t you?</p>
<p>The Summer 2021 update isn’t quite ready yet, but I’m happy to announce the Public Beta details.</p>
<p>You can join the TestFlight Public Beta list <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/5boXJnkI">here</a>.</p>
<p>You should also consider joining the <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/dzelytra/shared_invite/zt-dzvct3id-~io6HriB1OrQJ_Ib9PXCsw">Slack Group</a> for sharing feedback, screenshots, videos and the list. Head over the #iOS channel there.</p>
<p>If you don’t prefer Slack, the support email is always open.</p>
<p>I won’t be sharing the change log here. It’s available on the TestFlight log for now. You should go through it carefully before installing the new beta.</p>
<p>This brings the app back up to parity with v2.2.3 albeit with two features currently disabled. I will commence work on the new features and widgets later this week. </p>
<p>I look forward to your feedback. Cheers.</p>
