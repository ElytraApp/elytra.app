<p>Once again, let’s begin with the abstract confusing title.</p>
<p>But it’s a real one. Here’s some proof.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="prevnextupdown.jpg" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2018/03/prevnextupdown.jpg" alt="commit screenshot" width="512" height="384" border="0" /></p>
<p>As you can see, that’s an actual commit. Well, allow me to explain why this exists in the first place.</p>
<p>When you going through a lot of items in a feed, you may find yourself requiring to quickly move between those items or within an item itself. This is particular useful when you’re researching something. The search (which I talk about <a href="http://blog.yeti.dezinezync.com/2018/03/14/strings-search-and-sanity/">here</a>) feature ties into this specific bit.</p>
<p>So what is <strong>previous next up and down</strong>? Think about it in terms of the article. So what you get is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Previous article</li>
<li>Next article</li>
<li>Beginning of article</li>
<li>End of article</li>
</ol>
<p>So now you never have to leave the reading interface and can go for a reading spree if that’s your thing.</p>
