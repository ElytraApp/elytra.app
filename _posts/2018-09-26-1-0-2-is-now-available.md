<p>Elytra 1.0.2 is now generally available on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/elytra/id1433266971?ls=1&amp;mt=8">App Store</a>. You can read the full change-log on the App Store (I wont repeat it here) but there are a few changes which I’ll be talking about in this post. </p>
<h2>New On-Boarding</h2>
<p>When I was Beta testing the app, Craig Hockenberry gave me critical feedback that prompting users for an In-App Purchase when on-boarding them was a bad idea with Auto-Renewable Subscriptions. I agreed with him and changed this later. This was bad because the onus was on you to cancel your subscription in time if you did not like the app. </p>
<p>With this release however, Auto Renewing Subscriptions are no longer available until I resolve this issue with the App Store Review team. The App now implements non-renewing Subscriptions and offers a single Free Trial period of 14 days. </p>
<p>Since I was implementing this change, I decided to rework the On-Boarding UI as well. Here's how it looks now:</p>
<div><img title="newonboarding-1.PNG" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2018/09/newonboarding-1.png" alt="New Onboarding - Launch Screen" width="562" height="1218" border="0" /> <img title="newonboarding-2.PNG" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2018/09/newonboarding-2.png" alt="New Onboarding - Private Account" width="562" height="1218" border="0" /> <img title="newonboarding-3.PNG" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2018/09/newonboarding-3.png" alt="New Onboarding - Free Trial Unlock" width="562" height="1218" border="0" /></div>
<p>I’d like to hear your thoughts on this.</p>
<h2>Improved Voice Over Support</h2>
<p>I continue to improve Voice Over Support throughout the app and this build corrects a few issues when reading paragraphs, especially if you rotate your device or when paragraphs are drawn as you scroll.</p>
<h2>What's Next</h2>
<p>Getting this build out took much longer than I expected. I hit the wall several times with App Store Review but I'm glad all of that is finally over. I can now continue to focus on actually implementing new features and improving the app.</p>
<p>So, I have 1.0.3 in the pipeline already with a couple of more fixes to the actual reading experience before I begin work on 1.1.0. So if you've been waiting for a Test Flight Beta Invite from me, you can expect that soon now.</p>
<p>If you love the app and would like to be on the Test Flight Beta, just ping me in the comments on the website or ping me on Twitter or Micro.blog.</p>
<p>As always, I'd love to hear from you and to everyone who has a purchased a subscription: <strong>Thank you</strong> for supporting my work.</p>
