<h2>Web Service</h2>
<p>Over the last couple of days, I have been testing a new way for reliably fetching and caching RSS data from your favourite RSS feeds. </p>
<p>Ironically, my preliminary implementation of this <em>reliable</em> method wasn’t all that reliable usually not adding new articles to the database. Luckily, I caught this issue within 24h and has now been patched. </p>
<p>This change matters for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Although this new method is slower by almost 50%, it uses less resources like CPU and RAM, so I was able to downsize the server that runs this process. This means a small reduction in operating costs for me. </li>
<li>I have improved logging across the board so now I’ll know exact reasons why a particular RSS Feed failed to update. So the next time if you reach out to me telling me a feed wasn’t updated in a while, I should be able to resolve it quicker. </li>
</ol>
<h2>iOS App</h2>
<p>The progress on this has been slower than I had hoped. iOS 13 is changing a lot across the Betas, and has been one of the buggiest releases in recent memory. I have all the major things covered but I’m most likely not going to release the iOS 13 release of Elytra until the iOS 13 GM becomes available. </p>
<h2>macOS App</h2>
<p>Yes, this is planned. But in the mean time, <a href="https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a> is out in Public Beta. Definitely give it a shot. </p>
