<p>The April release of Elytra focuses on clearing up old code and files from Elytraâ€™s codebase. A lot is changing under the hood, but very little is changing visually in the app.</p>
<p>This is to prime the codebase for WWDC 2022 which will bring in new OS versions and features to the app.</p>
<p>If you feel generous and have a couple of minutes, please <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1433266971?action=write-review">leave a review on the App Store</a>. It makes a huge difference for me. Thank you in advance.</p>
