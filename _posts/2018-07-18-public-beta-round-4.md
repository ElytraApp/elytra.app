<p>Elytra Build 110 is now available to all beta testers. This is a sizeable change-log so get ready. </p>
<h2>Whats New</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Publisher title is now included in the Article view. This is very useful when browsing through articles in the Unread or Bookmarked section.</li>
<li>New Subscriptions interface. You’ll see it once during the beta. You won’t be charged for the subscription when you install builds through Testflight. </li>
<li>Off by default, you can now toggle to have Article cover images show up in the Feed interface. To manage this setting, open the App’s settings &gt; Image Handling, scroll right to the end. Articles without cover images will continue to behave as they have always done.  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Improves handling of folders when deleting a feed from a folder or deleting the folder itself.</li>
<li>When importing your OPML file, the File Picker Interface will now allow for selection of files saved with the <code>.opml</code> extension as well. </li>
<li>Improved the functioning of the OPML interface for imports and exports.</li>
<li>Improved system for managing unread counts on the Feeds interface. </li>
<li>Code blocks now support dynamic type. </li>
<li>Removed the subscriptions interface from the Introduction interface. The subscriptions interface will now popup once after you add your first feed.</li>
<li>Tapping the search button in the Article’s Interface will dismiss the Search bar if it’s already active. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a memory consumption issue caused when really long articles are opened.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the cover image of an article would render twice, once as the cover image and the other as an image inside the post.</li>
<li>Fixed padding of code blocks.</li>
<li>Fixes height of rendered tweets. </li>
<li>Rotating to a new orientation no longer causes a black out in the Article interface. </li>
<li>Fixed a rendering bug for new lines and extraneous spaces in paragraphs.</li>
<li>Fixed handling of push notification taps. </li>
<li>Fixed the width of the search bar (in the Articles interface) on iPads.</li>
<li>When you update the theme on the iPad and if an article is open, the article will refresh to accommodate for this change. </li>
<li>Fixed the appearance of the New Feed and New Folder inputs. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Notes</h3>
