<blockquote>
<p>The difference between getting news from an RSS reader and getting it from Facebook or Twitter or Nuzzel or Apple News is a bit like the difference between a Vegas buffet and an a la carte menu. In either case, you decide what you actually want to consume. But the buffet gives you a whole world of options you otherwise might never have seen.</p>

<p>That’s an excellent analogy.</p>
<p>And...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>RSS readers obviously have their own shortcomings as well. The firehose approach can easily overwhelm, especially when multiple outlets all publish the same news at the same time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So introducing filters in Yeti was definitely a good idea.</p>
<p>And some more...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The readers all have settings to help cope with these issues to varying degrees, where possible; it's just a matter of how many hours you want to spend shaping your RSS bonsai.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And thus Yeti’s approach to get you started with the basics, yet empower you with power tools. </p>
<p>I believe I’m doing the right thing here. Given how much attention this post has garnered over the last couple of hours, I think the timing is just right for Yeti. I guess I’ll just have to go right into the 6th gear and ramp up production. </p>
