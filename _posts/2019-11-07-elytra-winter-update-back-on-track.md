<p>I <a href="https://blog.elytra.app/2019/11/04/elytra-winter-update-delayed/">published</a> earlier this week that Elytra’s Winter update was delayed because of a major bug in the iOS 13.2 SDK causing the app to get rejected in review. Apple has since released updated tools which fix this issue. I’m submitting the update for review once again today. </p>
<p>I have also been reading about faster review times since 1st November. I hope this trend continues. </p>
