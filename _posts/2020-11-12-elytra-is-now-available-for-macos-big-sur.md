<p>Elytra is now available on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/elytra/id1433266971">Mac App Store</a>.</p>
<p>It’s finally happened.&nbsp;It took 3 years and I hope it was worth the wait.</p>

<p>Elytra for macOS brings the same native rendering performance you have come to know and love on iOS and iPad OS.</p>
<p>All of this has been possible because of Apple’s Mac Catalyst system which has been significantly improved on Big Sur, since its debut on macOS Catalina.</p>
<p>Your subscription will carry forward to the macOS App as well, no separate purchase or subscription will be necessary. (You can also take this opportunity to take advantage of the <a href="https://blog.elytra.app/2020/10/30/diwali-2020-discounted-pricing/">special pricing</a> I have going on for Diwali)</p>
<p>I’ll be sharing a deep-dive into the design decisions for Elytra, but for now, I hope you enjoy the release.</p>
<p>As always, Happy Reading!</p>
<p>PS: A small update for iOS and iPadOS has also been released, so be sure to grab that from the App Store as well.&nbsp;</p>
