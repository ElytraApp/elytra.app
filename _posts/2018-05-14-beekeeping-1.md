<p>A few minor bugs slipped through the first beta. So this is a house keeping build that fixes some of those issues. </p>
<h2>What’s fixed</h2>
<ul>
<li>On iPads with enough horizontal space, the article helper view is aligned to the right. I’m still figuring out how to work this in RTL modes.</li>
<li>When an article specifies a linebreak, Elytra’s text engine added extra space before and after the linebreak view. This is no longer the case.</li>
<li>Fixed an odd line-spacing bug that popped up in iOS 11.3.1.</li>
<li>Fixed 11.3.1’s kerning bug.</li>
<li>Foot links scroll jump to section has been fixed where it never flashed the background colour to indicate the highlighted paragraph.  </li>
<li>Fixed a not so rare crash that would occur when removing an article from your bookmarks. </li>
<li>Improvements to Attributions controller. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Version: 1.0.0</li>
<li>Build 69.</li>
<li>Pipe: Beta-02</li>
</ul>
