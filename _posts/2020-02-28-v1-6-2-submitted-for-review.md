<p>I just finished submitting the v1.6.2 build for review. It’ll be released automatically to everyone once it passes review and finishes processing for the App Store. </p>
<p>It fixes two bugs: </p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug which caused the app to launch with the Empty State Interface with no way to navigate within the app when opened in split-view mode on compatible iPads.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that would occur when launching the app from a cold state.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m also happy to note that work on v1.7 of the iOS app is nearing completion. It won’t be released until Summer, 2020 though. It’ll be released alongside something else. So stay subscribed to know more about that. </p>
