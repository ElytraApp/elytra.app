<p>I’ve spent the weekend planning for the upcoming 1.1.0 release of Elytra. It’s been a very enlightening weekend for me as to what ya’ll are looking for in an RSS Reader as well as some features and improvements I want to bring to the app. </p>
<p>This is what the Roadmap is currently looking like for this release. </p>
<p><img title="Roadmap.jpg" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2018/10/Roadmap.jpg" alt="Elytra 1.1.0 Roadmap presently scheduled for 20 October, 2018." width="1025" height="550" border="0" /></p>
<p>If there is something else you’d like to see included in this release, please feel free to email me, or you can also find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/dezinezync">Twitter</a>. My Direct Messages are open to everyone. </p>
<p>The date in the screenshot is a tentative date and is likely to change but as far as possible, I’d like to stick and commit to that date. </p>
<p>If you notice, we have an established schedule here. 1.5 months per release is a decent timeframe. There is no guarantee that it’ll be maintained due to several factors being outside my control, I will certainly try my best.</p>
<h3>Test Flight Update</h3>
<p>As work has now commenced on the 1.1.0 release, if you haven’t joined the latest Test Flight Beta group, you can now do so from this direct link: <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/WiHZBq4P">https://testflight.apple.com/join/WiHZBq4P</a></p>
<p>That is all from me for this week. I’m most likely going to be a hermit for this week sorting out all the layouts and such so please do excuse me if I respond to your emails slower than usual. </p>
