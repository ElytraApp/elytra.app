<p>Elytra v2.3 has just been released, you can read all about <a href="https://blog.elytra.app/2021/05/18/elytra-summer-2021-update/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I’m also excited to announce that Elytra is now also available on macOS as a Notarized app. You can head over <a href="https://github.com/dezinezync/Elytra/releases">here</a> to download the latest release.</p>
<p>It’s same as the Mac App Store release with two distinct differences:</p>
<ol>
<li>The app can auto-update itself (or you can manually check for updates) between the two Release and Test Build pipelines. The release line is recommended for most users, the test line is for those who like living on the edge.</li>
<li>The app will use an external Payment Processor which enables me to offer discounts, especially for students, you can read more about it <a href="https://faq.elytra.app/2021/subscriptions/">here</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Going forward, I’ll be able to release more frequent fixes directly to the Notarized builds. These builds currently do not have any kind of crash reporter built-in. So if you encounter any crashing bugs, please do take a moment to send me the crash report.</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing from you about this, you can always reach out to me on <a href="https://twitter.com/dezinezync">twitter</a> or email me at <a href="mailto:support@elytra.app">support@elytra.app</a>. Happy Reading.</p>
