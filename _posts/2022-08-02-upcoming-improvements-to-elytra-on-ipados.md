<p>For the iOS 16 release of Elytra, I’m working on bringing improvements to the iPadOS side of things. </p>
<p>Lots of things are planned but the very first I wanted to tackle was improved multi-scene support for Elytra. </p>
<p>There is a lot of work to be done in this aspect, but the initial stage is set. Here’s a glimpse of that:</p>

<p>If you have a special request for Elytra for iPadOS, feel free to open an issue <a href="https://github.com/ElytraApp/IssueTracker/issues">here</a> or email me at <a href="mailto:support@elytra.app">support@elytra.app</a>.</p>
