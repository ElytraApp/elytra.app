<p>This post outlines the Long Term Support (or LTS for short) plan for current and upcoming releases:</p>
<h2 id="ios:">iOS:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>v2.6.x is scheduled to be released soon and will be the last version to support iOS 14.0â€“14.7.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>v2.7.0 will support iOS 15.0 and later only.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If any critical fixes are required for iOS 14.x support, they will be released in the 2.6.x pipeline.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="macos:">macOS:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>v2.6.x is scheduled to be released soon ad will be the last version to support macOS 11.0 (Big Sur).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>v2.7.0 will support macOS 12.0 and later only.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If any critical fixes are required for macOS 11.x support, they will be released in the 2.6.x pipeline.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="timelines">Timelines</h3>
<p>The v2.6.x pipeline will continue to receive critical fixes, if any are necessary, for up to 6 months after v2.6.0 is released. After that date, no critical fixes will be issued and LTS support will end for those releases.</p>
<p>Hopefully with the release of v2.7.0, the LTS support will span for longer durations considering more features being supported now in iOS 15 and macOS 12.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the LTS plan, feel free to <a href="mailto:support@elytra.app">get in touch</a> with me over email.</p>
