The April 2024 release brings a improvements and bug fixes to both the iOS and mac apps.

If you feel generous and have a couple of minutes, please leave a [review on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1433266971?action=write-review). It makes a huge difference for me. Thank you in advance.

- Fixed a crashing bug that would sometimes occur when adding a new feed.

- Fixed syncing of feed updates and changes across devices.

- Improved sync: changes to feeds and folders are now picked up before syncing articles begins. 

- Fixed a bug where article enclosures would not get saved properly to disk. 

- Fixed a bug where articles with no explict cover image assigned, would show no cover image, if it had an image enclosure. 

- Fixed a bug where article enclosures without any articles would linger around consuming disk space. These are now cleaned up when the app starts. 

- `iOS`: Fixed split view behaviour on iPads
