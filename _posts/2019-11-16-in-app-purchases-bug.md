<p>A recent minor change in Apple's Receipt Verification process left a lot of existing and new users with a non-working app.</p>
<p>I did not catch this change until two users emailed me about being unable to use the app or sign up.</p>
<p>I noticed today morning that a lot of new users havent been able to sign up for the Free Trial either.</p>
<p>I have fixed this issue and new signups are now working as expected. If you tried signing up in the last two days or havent been able to use the app due to expired subscription errors, just restore your purchases from within the app.</p>
<p>I apologize for not catching this issue in time. Happy Reading.</p>
