<p>The global pandemic is not coming to a state of resolution any time soon. States across the globe are issuing lockdowns. Since we’re going to be stuck indoors for sometime, I have decided to slash the rates of all Elytra Non-Renewing Subscriptions to half their standard price. This pricing will be applicable up to 30th April, 2020. I’ll retain these prices if the global situation does not improve.</p>
<p>For brevity:</p>
<ol>
<li>1 Month: USD 0.99 / INR 79.</li>
<li>3 Months: USD 2.99 / INR 249.</li>
<li>12 Months: USD 11.99/ INR 899.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have any questions, please feel free to email me at support@elytra.app.</p>
<p>If you’re a student, please email me and I’ll hook you up with some free upgrades.</p>
<p>Stay safe.</p>
<p><strong>Update 1 (2020-04-24 10:40AM IST):</strong> The above pricing will be the new standard pricing and will not revert back on the 30th of April.</p>
