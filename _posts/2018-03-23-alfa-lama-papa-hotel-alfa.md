<p>If you’re familiar with the NATO phonetic alphabet, you’ve already postulated what the post is about. Keeping things in fashion, allow me to burst out of my shell of excitement and say, Project “Yeti” is finally real. </p>
<p>Yes, it has always been real. Real for me. But now, with today’s alpha release, it’s real-er as more people are onboard. So to everyone who is, you probably are already testing things it, playing around with it, tinkering it, breaking it, and what have you. So have a blast using it, just as I have working on it up to this point. </p>
<p>I did manage to sneak in “one-more-thing” into the alpha release which was planned for way later. “Add to Yeti” from the share extension. It isn’t the most perfect implementation, but it is usable. It’ll enable you to get off the ground more quickly.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to import your existing stuff into Yeti, well, sorry. But that didn’t make into this build as I wasn’t able to thoroughly test it. So if you have your OPML file ready, feel free to email it to me as it’ll aid me test the system better. </p>
<p>I’ll spare you with the technical details in this post. A year’s worth of work has finally taken shape of an actual product. I’ll allow myself to enjoy that feeling, while you enjoy the app (or utterly hate it…)</p>
