<p>The May release of Elytra focuses on clearing up old code and files from Elytra’s codebase. A lot is changing under the hood, but very little is changing visually in the app.</p>
<p>This is to prime the codebase for WWDC 2022 which will bring in new OS versions and features to the app.</p>
<p>This will be the final release to support iOS 14. This will also be the final release with new features until the next release shipping with iOS 16 support.</p>
<hr />
<p>As <strong>WWDC</strong> approaches, we’ll be seeing a lot of articles coming from the press surrounding the event. RSS feeds are a great way to follow this news as it happens.</p>
<p>So to get you setup, first 1000 users can get their first three months at a discounted price using the code: <code>EYTWWDC22</code> for the monthly subscription, and <code>EYYWWDC22</code> for the yearly subscription.</p>
<p>These codes will be valid till the 12th of June, 2022, 12:00AM GMT.</p>
<hr />
