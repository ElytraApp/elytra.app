<p>In late 2020, Apple adjusted pricing for the Indian AppStore which raised the pricing for Monthly and Yearly subscriptions. </p>
<p>Starting tomorrow: 5th Jan, 2021 Iâ€™ve calibrated the amounts back to the original pricing. This resets the monthly pricing back to INR 79/month. Most other regions will remain unaffected. The yearly pricing has been reduced for most regions though. </p>
<p>Apple has recently accepted me in their Small Business Program, which makes this recalibration possible for me, so I can forward these savings to you, my customers. </p>
