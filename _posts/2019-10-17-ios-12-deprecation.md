<p>Apple recently updated their Support page stating updated iOS 13 adoption metrics. Chance Miller (9To5Mac) <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/10/16/apple-says-ios-13-is-now-running-on-50-of-all-iphones-ipados-adoption-hits-33/">wrote about it</a> in detail. With over 50% on iPhones and 30% on iPads, this seems like a good time to deprecate iOS 12 support from Elytra. </p>
<p>Elytra for iOS v1.5 will be the last pipeline to support iOS 12. v1.6 which is scheduled for Spring 2020 will drop iOS 12 support completely. Some excellent changes await in in v1.6 and I cannot wait to share more details with you. </p>
