<p>Version 2.0.1 (31) should now be processing for the App Store and should become available shortly. I run into a small hiccup with the Review Process causing a small delay with the release.</p>
<p>This release mostly contains fixes for a few crashing bugs and it’s highly recommended, if you’re running iOS 14 now, that you update to this release.</p>
<h3 id="fixes">Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Various fixes for adding new feeds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed applying selected tint colours globally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deleting a feed (which is inside a folder) no longer collapses the folder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixes a crash on opening the Notifications Interface if you have 0 subscriptions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixes a crash on adding a feed from the Share Extension</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some minor issues I am aware of. I’ll post another release next week to address those.</p>
<p>In the mean time, happy reading.</p>
