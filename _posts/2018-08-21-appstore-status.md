<p>Elytra’s App Store status has been quite a weird roller-coaster ride for me. I’ve had my fair share of odd App Store rejections in the past, but none like this one. </p>
<p>After going in to the <strong>In Review</strong> status, the App was rejected a few hours later for including Auto-Renewable subscriptions. This seemed odd considering all the information Apple requires apps to be displayed on the <em>Purchase</em> screen was there. Turns out, that was not case. The subscriptions were rejected because they were, “Not valid use of the service”. </p>
<p>Upon presenting my case in the resolution centre that Elytra was adhering to all rules as laid out by the App Store Guidelines, I was once again told that this was invalid use of the service. The reviewer recommended that I instead use a Non-Auto Renewing Subscription. </p>
<p>At this point I decided to write an appeal to the App Store Review Board and see what happens. The In-App Purchases are back to being <strong>In Review</strong> and the app itself is now <strong>Waiting for Review</strong>..</p>
<h3>Where does this leave me?</h3>
<p>The account on which Elytra is being reviewed expires shortly. I have a new account all set up and ready to go and I don’t plan to renew the existing account if the app does not pass review. I’ll setup and resubmit the app from the new account. </p>
<p>However, if by some miracle, the app does pass review now, I’ll promptly renew the account and continue using it. If this happens, I have nothing else to do. I upload the website and release the app. </p>
<p>If I do end up setting it up on the new account:</p>
<ul>
<li>TestFlight access to the app will cease.</li>
<li>Since I’m setting up a new app, it will no longer use data from the old app. Your subscriptions will be safe and you can simply setup the same account in the new app. </li>
<li>I’ll have to implement a Non-Renewable Subscription which isn’t the best user experience considering you’ll have to manually renew the subscription every month, 3 months or year depending on your subscription type. </li>
</ul>
<p>So I hope things work out for Elytra as it stands right now. Setting up a new app will be incredibly tedious to say the least with a lot of undesirable effects. </p>
<p>I simply wonder why the Review Team is rejecting Elytra’s use of Auto-Renewable Subscriptions when prior art for the purpose exists in the App Store. Heck, its even promoted in Searches.</p>
