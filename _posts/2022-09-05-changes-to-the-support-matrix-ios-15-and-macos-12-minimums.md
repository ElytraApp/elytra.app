<p>iOS 16 and macOS 13 (Ventura) have been available in Public Beta for a couple of weeks now.</p>
<p>They will be generally available in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>With on-going efforts to modernise Elytra&#8217;s codebase, and keep things lean &amp; fast, the next release of Elytra (v2022.8) will be dropping support for older OSes. The new support matrix is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>iOS</strong>:
<ul>
<li>iOS 15</li>
<li>iOS 16</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>macOS</strong>:
<ul>
<li>macOS 12 (Monterey)</li>
<li>macOS 13 (Ventura)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With 96% of active users already on one of these supported releases, the migration will be seamless for you. If you are using devices on older releases, the current version available on the App Store (v2022.7) will continue to work. As no API deprecations are planned, this will not affect usability of the current release in any way.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited for the v2022.8 release and new features planned for upcoming releases, some of which you can see in the <a href="https://github.com/ElytraApp/IssueTracker/issues">Public Issue Tracker</a>.</p>
