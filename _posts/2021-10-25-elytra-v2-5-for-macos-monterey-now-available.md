<p>Elytra is now optimised and available for macOS Monterey. It also includes performance and usability optimisations for macOS Big Sur. You can download it directly from <a href="https://github.com/dezinezync/Elytra/releases/latest">here</a> or from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/in/app/elytra/id1433266971">App Store</a>.</p>
<p>This is the first release with a modern and cutting-edge foundation which focuses on reliability, stability and ease of adding new features in future releases.</p>
<p>If you feel generous and have a couple of minutes, please leave a <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1433266971?action=write-review">review on the App Store</a>. It makes a huge difference for me. Thank you in advance.</p>
<hr />
<p>Along with the macOS release, a small iOS release is also available which brings the most recent fixes to the iOS app and brings the two on parity.</p>
