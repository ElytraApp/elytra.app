<p>2019 has been Elytra’s first full year in Production. It has since gone from v1.1 to v1.5 with work having begun on v1.6 before I left for a small vacation (following my wedding) in December. </p>
<p>Over this year, Elytra’s UI has evolved significantly and with the v1.6 changes, it is about to become a whole lot better. Here are some quick stats over the year, reflecting on how Elytra has grown: </p>
<ul>
<li>New Feeds: 2K+</li>
<li>New Articles: 5M+</li>
<li>New Users with Push Notifications Enabled: 700+</li>
<li>Average Unique Articles read every day: 100+</li>
<li>Average Unique Users active every day: 100+</li>
</ul>
<p>To put these numbers into perspective: </p>
<ul>
<li>New Feeds YoY Change: + 1666.67%</li>
<li>New Articles YoY Increase: + 312.5%</li>
<li>New Users with Notifications Enabled YoY Change: + 8750% </li>
<li>Average Unique Articles YoY Change: +850%</li>
<li>Average Unique Users YoY Change: +1800%</li>
</ul>
<p>I also managed to reduce Elytra’s Monthly server bill by 15% by optimising certain parts of the code while improving processing speeds. Once I get that figure down to approximately 40-50% (or revenue increases which bridges the gap), I hope to pass on the savings to Elytra’s users and finally introduce the Free Tier. </p>
<p>I wish you all a very Happy New Year. May all your plans for the new year succeed.  </p>
