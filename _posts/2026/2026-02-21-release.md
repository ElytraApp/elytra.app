Elytra v2026.2.0 delivers a fresh Liquid Glass look, performance improvements, and deeper customization for iOS 26 and iPadOS 26.

If you feel generous and have a couple of minutes, please leave a [review on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1433266971?action=write-review). It makes a huge difference for me. Thank you in advance.

- Uses the common rendering framework, which is now mostly shared by the iOS & Mac app.

### Improved

  - especially those which list multiple sources and formats
  - and videos which use unsupported attributes like `data-src` and `data-poster`
- Improved handling of overlapping text style ranges for CJK scripts
- Improved content matching for footnote popovers and the default scrolling behaviour 

### Fixes

- Fixed opening URLs in the app
