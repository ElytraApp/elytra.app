<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Please copy your Account ID and keep it safe somewhere (Notes.app or whatever else you may be using for keeping notes). When the app launches on the App Store, if you wish to retain your account, you can use the same Account ID to get access to your feeds again. If you want to be re-inducted into the Public Beta, please send me an email stating so.</p>

<p>Elytra went through a second round of App Store Review following an appeal and it got rejected again. As I noted in my previous post (You can read it <a href="https://blog.elytra.app/2018/08/21/appstore-status/">here</a>), if that ended up happening, I’ll have to take some drastic steps. </p>
<p>Since I cannot transfer an app which uses iCloud in any way, I had to recreate Elytra on my new Developer ID. </p>
<h2>Test Flight</h2>
<p>With this change, I ended up with two identical apps on my phone. This is fine for me, however, the ramifications of this are big if you are part of the Beta Testing groups. </p>
<p>The former Developer account expires tomorrow which will remove Elytra from Test Flight (renamed to YetiReader so I can continue using Elytra on the new account). If you wish to continue being a part of the Public Beta group, please send me an email through Test Flight or direct at: <a href="mailto:info@dezinezync.com">info@dezinezync.com</a> and mention your Test Flight Email ID.</p>
<p>A good thing to come out of this situation: I have a much much better build which I’ll be shipping as 1.0.0. I’ve added multiple fixes, improvements and UI polish which was lacking from the latest build currently available. </p>
<p>I am not sure if the Test Flight build will continue to work once the former account expires. I know the build will no longer be available, but I am not sure if it’ll continue to work.</p>
<h2>App Store</h2>
<p>I believe I have a better idea as to why Elytra was rejected from using Auto Renewing Subscriptions. It’s just a guess at this point. I’ll be submitting the new build from the new account on Monday with all the new changes and improvements. I’m getting everything in order over the weekend. </p>
<p>Hoping everything goes well this time round. If you no longer wish to be a part Public Beta, you don’t need to do anything. If you wish to continue using Elytra when it releases on the App Store, I strongly recommend you copy your Account ID to somewhere safe like Notes.app or whatever else you may be using. </p>
<p>Thank you for sticking by me and keeping me motivated. </p>
